                        <h5>Teaching</h5>
                        <p>I started teaching children when I was still a child. I enjoyed it and never made the conscious decision to be a teacher, but was always the most happy when I was sharing a skill that I was capable of teaching with others, and that was usually some form of exercise. It started as swimming and now I have taught dance, regular sports like basketball and soccer, and I have had students act out a dance basketball routine for PE as well. Over my life, I have been respobsible for teaching over 700 children. I could not see myself finding as much joy anywhere else.</p>
                        <p>I have worked as a swim coach over the course of 5 years, and have worked with ages 1-18 years old. I have spent about 165 hours coaching swim teams since I was 14 years old. From 14-16, I volunteered 3 different summers as a swim coach to a recreational team. </p>
                        <p>I started working in a classroom getting work experience at 17 years old in high school. I worked in a kindergarten, a first grade class, a third grade classroom helping lead reading, and teaching a math lesson. That was my introduction to teaching in the school system.</p>
                        <p>I have worked as a physical education teacher, and had 245 junior high school students. I did this for four months, and crafted lessons that were applicable to their everyday life once they graduate.</p>
                        <h5>Coding</h5>
                        <p>I have worked as an intern for Elevate Global. I researched ways to measure social impact and found over 100 different ways. I was in charge of creativity and coded the spreadsheets for better organization and overall presentation.</p>
                        <p>I have taken a couple of coding classes, and have learned VBA, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I made this website using bootstrap and have made another one from scratch with HTML and CSS.</p>
